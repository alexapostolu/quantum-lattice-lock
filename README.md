Quantum resistant lattice encryption

A popular encryption method is RSA, which relies on the fact that finding prime factors of large numbers is a long process even for super computers. However quantum computers can easily accomphish this task.

NIST proposed a new standard of encryption using lattice paths, that supposedly not even quantum computers can break. I will be implementing my own version of this in Rust.
